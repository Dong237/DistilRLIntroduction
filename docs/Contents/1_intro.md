# Chapter 1. Introduction to RL

- Definition

- tpyes:
    - deterministic env: the next state and the value of the reward are always the same given a certain state, action pair.

    - episode / continuous

- Examples


- Elements of Reinforcement Learning

    - policy

    - reward model

    - value function

    - model of the environment (optional): By a model of the environment we mean anything that an agent can use to predict how the environment will respond to its actions. Given a state and an action, a model produces a prediction of the resultant next state and next reward.
